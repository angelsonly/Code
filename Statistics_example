The National Sleep Foundation (www.sleepfoundation.org) reports that around
3% of the American population has sleep apnea. They also report that around 10%
of the North American and European population has restless leg syndrome.
Similarly, they report that 58% of adults in the US experience insomnia. Does this
imply that 71% of people will have at least one sleep problems of these sorts?

Answer: No, the events are not mutually exclusive. To elaborate let:
A1 = {Person has sleep apnea}
A2 = {Person has RLS}
A3 = {Person has insomnia}
Then (work out the details for yourself)
P(A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3) = P(A1) + P(A2) + P(A3)
− P(A1 ∩ A2) − P(A1 ∩ A3) − P(A2 ∩ A3)
+ P(A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3)
= .71 + Other stuff
where the “Other stuff” has to be less than 0
